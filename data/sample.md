# RAG Concepts

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models with facts fetched from external sources.

## Core Components
1. **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base.
2. **Generation**: Using the retrieved information to generate a response.

## Vector Databases
Vector databases store high-dimensional vectors (embeddings) which represent data items. They allow for semantic search.
